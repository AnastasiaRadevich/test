## Summary

It’s my pleasure to introduce myself in front of you. My name is Anastasia. Firstly, I’d like to tell you about my personal qualities. Then, I’ll say a few words about my skills and responsibilities. Of course, I am going to explain why I’ve made up my mind to enter the RS School. And finally, I’ll talk about my ambitions and hopes.

So, let’s start with my personal qualities. I am creative, energetic, a little bit idealistic but rather practical at the same time. I really love solving problems. And I have a sense of humor. It means I understand and appreciate it. There are problems in everybody’s life, but a person with a sense of humor does not allow his problems to press upon him.

I am writing this text to express my interest in studying at the RS School. I want to get knowledge here, because if I want to achieve a lot in my life I have to learn from the best. It was said without any exaggeration, I think you already know.
